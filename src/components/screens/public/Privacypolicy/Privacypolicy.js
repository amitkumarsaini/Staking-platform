We work hard to protect the Personal Information you provide us from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access. We utilize a variety of safeguards such as encryption, digital and physical access controls, non-disclosure agreements, and other technical and organizational measures to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is at rest. Please note that no electronic transmission, storage, or processing of Personal Information can be entirely secure. We cannot guarantee that the security measures we have in place to safeguard Personal Information will never be breached or fail, or that those measures will always be sufficient or effective. Therefore, although we are committed to protecting your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect that your Personal Information will always remain private or secure.
